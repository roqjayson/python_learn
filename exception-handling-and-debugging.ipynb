In this notebook, we'll cover various topics to help you understand and effectively handle exceptions in your Python programs. Let's get started!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1. Understanding Exceptions\n\nAn exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception is raised, Python will stop executing the current block of code and jump to the nearest exception handler if there is one. Otherwise, the program will terminate.\n\nLet's look at a simple example:\n\n```python\nprint(1 / 0)  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError\n```\nTry running the code above to see the error.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(1 / 0)  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2. Using Try-Except Blocks\n\nTo handle exceptions gracefully, you can use `try-except` blocks. The `try` block lets you test a block of code for errors, and the `except` block lets you handle those errors.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    print(1 / 0)\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n```\nTry running this code to see how the exception is handled.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"try:\n    print(1 / 0)\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3. Handling Multiple Exceptions\n\nYou can handle multiple exceptions using multiple `except` blocks. This allows you to specify different responses to different types of exceptions.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Code that may raise multiple exceptions\n    value = int(\"string\")  # Raises ValueError\n    print(1 / 0)  # Raises ZeroDivisionError\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"ValueError occurred!\")\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"ZeroDivisionError occurred!\")\n```\nTry modifying this code to handle different exceptions.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"try:\n    # Code that may raise multiple exceptions\n    value = int(\"string\")  # Raises ValueError\n    print(1 / 0)  # Raises ZeroDivisionError\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"ValueError occurred!\")\nexcept ZeroDivisionError:\n    print(\"ZeroDivisionError occurred!\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4. Raising Exceptions\n\nYou can raise exceptions manually using the `raise` keyword. This can be useful for creating custom error messages or enforcing certain conditions.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```python\ndef divide(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n    return a / b\n\nprint(divide(10, 0))  # This will raise a ValueError\n```\nTry creating a function that raises an exception under certain conditions.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def divide(a, b):\n    if b == 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n    return a / b\n\nprint(divide(10, 0))  # This will raise a ValueError","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 5. Debugging Techniques and Tools\n\nDebugging is essential for identifying and fixing issues in your code. Python provides several tools for debugging, including print statements, logging, and interactive debuggers.\n\nWe'll focus on the `pdb` debugger, which allows you to step through code, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions interactively.\n\nTo use `pdb`, you can insert `pdb.set_trace()` in your code where you want to start debugging:\n\n```python\nimport pdb\n\ndef faulty_function(a, b):\n    pdb.set_trace()  # Start debugging here\n    return a / b\n\nfaulty_function(1, 0)  # This will raise an exception\n```\nTry adding `pdb.set_trace()` to your code and use it to step through and debug.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pdb\n\ndef faulty_function(a, b):\n    pdb.set_trace()  # Start debugging here\n    return a / b\n\nfaulty_function(1, 0)  # This will raise an exception","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Practice Exercises\n\n### Exercise 1: Exception Handling\nWrite a function that takes two numbers and divides them. Handle the case where the second number is zero using a `try-except` block.\n\n### Exercise 2: Multiple Exceptions\nModify the function from Exercise 1 to handle both `ZeroDivisionError` and `ValueError` (e.g., if the input is not a number).\n\n### Exercise 3: Raising Exceptions\nCreate a function that checks if a number is negative. If it is, raise a custom exception with an appropriate message.\n\n### Exercise 4: Debugging with pdb\nUse the `pdb` debugger to step through a function that calculates the factorial of a number and identify any issues.","metadata":{}}]}
